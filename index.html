  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Surfing, originating in ancient Polynesia around 2000 BCE, spread across the Pacific Islands before European contact, with a resurgence in Hawaii in the late 19th century driven by figures like Duke Kahanamoku. It gained popularity in the 20th century, particularly in California and Australia, thanks to innovations in board design and cultural influences from movies and music. Surfing became a global phenomenon with the establishment of competitions like the World Surf League, shaping not just a sport but also a cultural movement influencing music, fashion, and film. In the modern era, surfing continues to evolve with advancements in technology and a growing focus on environmental sustainability, remaining a cherished pastime and competitive sport with deep connections to nature and culture.</p>
